# Cached Attributes

Super simple caching for Ruby

```ruby
class Product
  attr_cached :orders_count

  def orders_count
    # ...
  end

end
```

Choose when to use the cached value

```ruby
product.orders_count        # not cached
product.cached_orders_count # cached
```

Force a re-cache [master]

```ruby
product.cache_orders_count!
```
